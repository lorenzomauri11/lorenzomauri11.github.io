<h1> Quick hummus recipe </h1> <br>

<p><strong> <u>This</u> recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong>It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that I
    have read over the years.
<p/>

<p> Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.
<p/>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p><em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) </em> <br>
    <em> 175g of tahini </em> <br>
    <em> 6 sundried tomatoes </em> <br>
    <em> Half a red pepper </em> <br>
    <em> A pinch of cayenne pepper </em> <br>
    <em> clove of garlic</em> <br>
    <em>A dash of olive oil </em> <br>
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
    <mark>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop</mark>
    <br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely <br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor <br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste. <br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time <br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time <br>
<p/>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
<p/>

<h4>Storage</h4>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>

<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
